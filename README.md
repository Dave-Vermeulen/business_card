# Personal Business Card Project 🚀💼

Welcome to my **Personal Business Card** project! 🎉 This project is part of my self-taught journey to become a developer, created during the *Intro to Digital* (ITD) course by [CodeYourFuture](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture) and built with guidance from the amazing [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com/) platform. 

## 🚀 Project Overview

This business card is a simple yet stylish representation of me, created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of magic 🪄. It's one of the foundational projects I've built as I continue to sharpen my skills in **frontend development**. While frontend design isn't my favorite (give me some backend action, please 😅), I know mastering these technologies is essential in today's tech space. And hey, why not have fun while we do it? 💡

### 🔥 Features:
- **Responsive Design**: It looks great across devices, ensuring my card shines no matter where you view it!
- **Hover Effects and Animations**: I’ve added modern touches to make this more interactive and engaging.
- **Creative Visuals**: Using bold colors and a minimalist structure to convey a personal and professional vibe.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the page
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript (optional)**: For extra functionality and interactivity (future improvements)
- **Vite**: A lightweight development server that’s super fast ⚡

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/business-card.git
2. Install the dependencies and run the project:
   ```bash
   npm install npm start
3. Head over to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to learn more about configuring and using Vite.

🎓 **Why I'm Learning This**

I’m on a journey to become a Junior Developer, and as part of that, I'm building foundational projects like this one. While frontend design can be challenging for me, I’m pushing through because I know how vital it is for landing a job in tech. 🏆 Every step I take, from coding a simple business card to solving bigger challenges, brings me closer to my goal.
